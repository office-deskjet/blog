Hacker Summer Camp: 7 Days in Las Vegas
=======================================
I am finally getting around to writing up my Las Vegas adventure.

If you don't know already, Hacker Summer Camp is the 11 days of security training and conferences in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.
It consists of `Black Hat <https://www.blackhat.com/>`_, `BSidesLV <https://www.bsideslv.org/>`_, and `DEF CON <https://defcon.org/>`_, in that chronological order.
Last year I just did DEF CON and this year my plan was to do a bit of all three.
I booked my tickets with SouthWest and got my stay at the Linq booked on the conference discount code.
SouthWest offers free checked bags, and if you are going to DEF CON you will be taking things with you that cannot be brought on the plane.
I came into Vegas on a Monday afternoon, which gave me enough time to unpack and grab some food.
Thankfully the Linq, had a mini-fridge in the room and I was able to store some leftover White Castle for breakfast.
I was bit too rushed working on my `#shittyaddon <https://twitter.com/itdirector/status/1026852643740602368>`_ to fully prepare for my trip.
Compared to last year, I did not bring enough food or any cash.
I highly advise bringing your own food with you unless you want to waste time and money on food.
First Vegas food is expensive, even in food courts. Second going out to find food takes away from con time.
My suggestion is to pack protein bars, apples, and trail mix.
Along with that bring a metal water bottle or two.
As for money, you will be need cash for DEF CON entry, vendor hall, badges, shittyaddons, food, taxis, etc.
I didn't bring any cash with so I hit the Strip for an ATM and food.
Several posts on TripAdvisor say that Casino Royale charges $1 fee.
I think I found the correct casino, but the fee was $3, which is not bad.
Come Tuesday morning I headed out to the Tuscany for BSidesLV.
BSides Las Vegas has a limited number of badges  and they are capped by the fire marshal on how many people can be in the conference space.
You can get a badge either by staying at the Tuscany, donating, volunteering, or walking in the day of for a free badge,
I am cheap and planed on getting a walkin badge.
When I got there around 07:00 people were already leaving saying there were no walkin badges.
Other people said there were a only a couple.
The official word  of the situation was not consistent.
I was bummed out that I would be missing my chance at BSides so I stuck it out in the line for walkin badges.
At least while I was in line i met `TwinkleTwinkie <https://twitter.com/mrtwinkletwink>`_, and some of the `AND!XOR <https://twitter.com/ANDnXOR>`_ crew.
I gave up on staying the line and tried some social engienering to see where that would take me.
I found my way to the pool and started taking to people seated at tables.
Eventually I met `Seattle Locksport <https://twitter.com/LockpickSeattle>`_, and he had a badge!
It probably helped that I used to vist `The Black Lodge <https://twitter.com/the_black_lodge>`_ for DC203 meetings and could name drop `Noid <https://twitter.com/_noid_>`_
